						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned the importance of white space and grouping contents. Grouping contents helps users understand what elements of the UI go together and what doesn't. This helps the overall usability and accessibility of the interface. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really liked all the examples they included of grouping and making elements similar. Giving low-fi UI examples helped to visualize the concepts discussed in the article. They also made the article more engaging. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> The Common Region principle is particularly useful. It can help with information grouping and content organisation, but it can also achieve content separation or act as a focal point. It boosts hierarchy, scanability and assists in promoting information. </p>
						</li>
