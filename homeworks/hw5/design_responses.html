                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that interaction design is really important for a product. It can make a huge difference. But has to be clean though, to not distract the user. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I really enjoyed studying all of the interactions and designs. Being able to see that variance was really interesting.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite was the landing page for Awesomed. I really enjoyed it because it was really simple, like only a few items on the page moved, but it was really effective. I like how it doesn't distract the user from the content, but provides some delightful visual variance. </p>
